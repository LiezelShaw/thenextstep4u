        <h1>A rocky start as a software developer ...</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>When I started my career way back in 1999 after getting my B.Sc Information Technology degree, I realized that
            I didn't really know as much as I thought I did.  I still had lots to learn to make it in the software
            development world.  Luckily I had a bit of a boost that set me up for my further career.  I'll tell you more about that
            in the video below.</p>

        <p>That whole experience made me realize that you don't really need a degree to become a good software developer, all you need
         is a willingness to learn and a determination to put the work in.</p>

        <p>It might be quite daunting to try figure out what you need to learn.  That is where I come in.  I'll be sending
             you periodic emails with loads of information about what to learn also some training and tutorials to get
            you on your way in the right direction.</p>
