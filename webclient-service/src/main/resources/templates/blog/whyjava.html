        <h1>Why Java</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            There are so many programming languages to choose from when deciding which one to learn.  It can be quite
            overwhelming to decide on the right one.  To help you with your decision, I have put together a video of
            reasons why Java is a good language to learn.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> Watch the video below to find out why Java is a good language to learn.</p>

        <h4><i>Transcript</i></h4>
        <p>People often ask me:  “Why Java?”</p>

        <p>Well, here are some of the reasons why Java is a good language to learn.</p>

        <p>Its a robust and powerful Object-Oriented language that is easy to learn.  If you are wondering what
            Object-orientation is, its where the programming language is based on the concept of “Objects” that contain
            fields or attributes as data and communicate with other object through methods.
            A simple example would be a Car.  A car can have a colour, wheels, engine and a driver.
            A driver is then another object with its own attributes and methods.</p>

        <p>Java is platform independent.  This means that you can develop and run a java program on any operating system
            as long as you have the Java Runtime Environment installed on it.  You can also develop your application on,
            let’s say a Mac and run it on either windows, linux or unix with no problem.</p>

       <p>The Java language is very simple.  However, Java comes with a library of classes that provide common
           functionality to make your life as a programmer easier.  This library is called the Java API.
           The Java language has only 50 keywords, but the Java API has several thousand classes that you can
           use in your programs.</p>

        <p>Besides the Java API, you also get hundreds of tools and frameworks for Java to help you even further,
            like Spring Framework, JUnit, Mockito, Spring Boot, JBoss, Payara, Maven and many, many more.</p>

        <p>There is also a very strong online community of Java Developers with lots of experts ready to help you
            when you get stuck on a problem.  One such platform is StackOverflow, where you can post your questions
            and get answers to solve your coding problems.  It is also well worth it to search through these sites
            for issues you are having.  Chances are that someone has been where you are before and has the answer for
            you.</p>

        <p>Java is widely used all over the world, from large corporations to small businesses.</p>

        <p>It is used on popular websites you might often use, such as Google, YouTube, LinkedIn, Amazon and eBay.
            Even software development tools like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA and NetBeans IDE are all written in Java.</p>

        <p>Java can be used to create all kinds of applications, from desktop and mobile Android apps to distributed
            applications that run across different servers and clients in a network.  Nowadays, Java is often the default
            choice for scientific applications, including natural language processing. The main reason for this is because
            it is safe, portable, maintainable.</p>

        <p>Depending on your career prospects, Java can take you on different career paths. Whether you’re interested in
            building games, mobile applications, desktop applications, or web applications, Java is capable of working
            in all these environments.</p>
