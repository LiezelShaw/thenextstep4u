            There are 4 principles of oop programming that you need to master.  Today I'll be discussing these
            principles with you in detail.  Take the time to go through them and maybe play around in an IDE with these
            principles to make sure that you understand them.

        <h2>4 Principles of Object-Oriented Programming</h2>

        <p>These 4 principles are an important part of object-oriented programming.   If you want to be successful in
            OOP, you need to know and understand these principles.  They are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism.  Iâ€™ll explain each of these to you with some examples.
        </p>
        <h4>Encapsulation</h4>
        <p>
            All attributes and methods related to an object get encapsulated in the object. Think about it as creating a capsule around the object.
            No outside object shouldhave access to the object's variables directly.  An object keeps its state private from other objects.
            If another object needs values from an object, it has to do so by using public methods.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lets look at our lego figurine class again:
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code> public class LegoFigurine {
    private String name;
    private Head head;
    private HeadCovering hairHat;
    private UpperBody shirt;
    private LowerBody legs;

    public void build() {
        // Method to show legoFigurine how to put itself together
    }
}
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            Here you can see that we use encapsulation in this class by making the attributes on the class private.
            The private keyword in Java means that only the class or object itself can access the attribute.
            You can also have private methods if needed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The methods are public.  That means that anyone outside the class can access and call those methods
            on the object.
        </p>
        <h4>Abstraction</h4>
        <p>
            This is a way of hiding the implementation of classes from others.  This means that other classes using
            the class can't see the internal workings of the class.
        </p>
        <p>
            Recently, my husband's car broke down. Neither of us knows much about cars and wouldn't even know where to
            start to get it fixed.  Luckily for us, we have these amazing people called Mechanics, who know exactly how
            to fix the car.  All we need to do is to ask the mechanic to fix the car for us.
        </p>
        <p>
            So you can say that the complexity of fixing the car is hidden from us as owners.
        </p>
        <p>
            In java code it would look as follows:
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>public class Car {
    String colour;
    String make;

    public Car(String colour, String make) {
        this.colour = colour;
        this.make = make;
    }
}
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>Here we have a Car, which has a specific colour and make.</p>

        <pre>
            <code>public class CarOwner {
    private String name;
    private String surname;
    private String cellNumber;
    private Car car;

    public CarOwner(String name, String surname, String cellNumber) {
        this.name = name;
        this.surname = surname;
        this.cellNumber = cellNumber;
    }

    public void setCar(Car car) {
        this.car = car;
    }

    public Car getCar() {
        return car;
    }

    public void takeCarToMechanic(Mechanic mechanic) {
        mechanic.fixCar(car);
    }
}
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            Thge CarOwner has a name, surname, cellNumber and a Car.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>public class Mechanic {
    private String name;
    private String surname;

    public void fixCar(Car car) {
        //Some code to fix the car for the owner
    }
}
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            The Mechanic also has a name and surname and knows how to fix the car.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>public class MainApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car("White", "Toyota Hilux");
        CarOwner owner = new CarOwner("Joe", "Soap", "047 445 3434");
        Mechanic mechanic = new Mechanic();
        owner.setCar(car);
        owner.takeCarToMechanic(mechanic);
    }
}
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            This is the main method of the application that runs the code.  Here we create and instantiate a Car,
            a CarOwner, and a Mechanic.  We then set the car on the owner, so that the owner has that specific car.
            The owner then calls the method 'takeCarToMechanic' and add a parameter specifying which mechanic to go to.
        </p>
        <p>In the 'takeCarToMechanic' method, the owner tells the mechanic to 'fixCar'.  The owner doesn't need to know
            how to fix the car, the mechanic will take care of that.  That is the concept of abstraction.
        </p>

        <p>
            I hope this makes the principles of Object Oriented Programming a little bit clearer.  If you have any questions, or
            comments for me, please leave a comment below and let me know.
