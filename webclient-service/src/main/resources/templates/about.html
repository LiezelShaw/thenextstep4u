            <h1>About Liezel Shaw</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>I’ve been doing Software Development since 1999, working on projects for various business and clients from
                corporates to small businesses to non-profits.  I’ve created applications in varying fields like merchant banking,
                accounting, client management, photography and marketing.</p>

            <p>Nowadays I work in the comfort of my own home, creating amazing applications for business and private clients,
                being involved in the full process from specs, design and development to deployment and sign-off from client.</p>

            <p>In addition to these development projects, I also teach Java Software Development  to new aspiring developers
                using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Java, Spring-boot and MongoDB or Mysql as well as all the other tools needed to help
                you with your software development journey.</p>

            <p>I am passionate about helping people take the next step on their journey and teach them to invest in themselves and
                further their knowledge in the software development field.</p>
